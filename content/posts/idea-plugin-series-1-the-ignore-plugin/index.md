## 1. Plug-in introduction

When using git, you often encounter some files that you don't want to submit (such as the `.idea` folder and its contents automatically generated by IDEA). At this time, you need to use the `.gitignore` file.

`.gitignore` does not need to be written completely from scratch, it can be automatically generated using the .ignore plugin.
